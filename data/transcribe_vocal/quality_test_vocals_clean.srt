1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,800
That's all right cause I like the way it hurts

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,160
Just gonna stand there and hear me burn

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,040
That's all right cause I like the way it lies

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
I love the way it lies

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,840
I can't tell you what it really is

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,960
I can tell you what it feels like

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,260
And right now this is still a nightmare of me

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,380
I can't breathe but I still fight

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,100
While I can't fight as long as the wall feels right

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,920
It's like I'm in it's like high above

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,140
Troph on my head

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,900
It's like I'm often hanging and I love it

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,820
The more I suffer

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,600
I stop the chain and break the form

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,440
I'm about to drown

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,880
She just not to taste me

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,140
She fucking hates me

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,240
And I love it way

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,040
Where you going?

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,020
I'm leaving you

22
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,960
Where you going?

23
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,460
Come back

24
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,620
We're running right back

25
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,660
Here we go again

26
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,440
So insane cause when it's going

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,240
It's going great

28
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm super married

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
But the wind is back

30
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,260
She's not a slave

31
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,860
But when it's bad it's awful

32
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,000
I feel slow to say

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,320
Who's that to?

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,820
I don't even know his name

35
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,100
I laid hands on her

36
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,560
I never stood so long again

37
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,260
I guess I don't know my old dreams

38
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,420
Just gonna stand there

39
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,200
And watch me burn

40
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,020
That's all right cause I like the way it hurts

41
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,140
Just gonna stand there and hear me burn

42
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,060
That's all right cause I love the way it hurts

43
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,800
Love the way it hurts

44
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,000
Love the way it hurts

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,640
Love the way it hurts

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,460
Love the way it hurts

47
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,500
Give her a love song

48
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,160
You can barely breathe

49
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,380
When you're breathing and you meet

50
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,460
And neither one of you

51
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,660
Even though it hit her

52
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,920
Got the wrong fuzzy feeling

53
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,580
Get it, she'll use the kid on her

54
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,520
You can't fucking stick her up to let him

55
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,860
You're slow, you never hit her

56
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,740
And I never do nothing

57
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,540
I've heard her lay her in each other's face

58
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,100
When you hit her in any births

59
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,740
When you spit him

60
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,640
You boost point

61
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,020
So the sad scratch pops

62
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,900
And on top

63
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,480
And I was a loss in my moments

64
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:04,960
When you hit her

65
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,700
And you're surprised that it's a car break

66
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,480
And chose to go

67
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,780
So I say I passed the car

68
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,580
You said it backwards

69
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,620
Guess it's bad on her

70
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,220
Cause today

71
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,280
That was just the day

72
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,440
Yes, the day is always a different day

73
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,360
So I like broken back

74
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,840
It's bad over for your problem

75
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,100
It's not

76
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,140
Next time it's over

77
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,880
You don't kiddin' of a kid

78
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,360
It's like there's no agenda game

79
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,300
But you like it

80
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,740
Now you get to watch a read

81
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,420
About the window

82
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,520
Guess what I call it

83
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,140
Windowplay

84
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,700
Just gonna stand there

85
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,580
Watch me burn

86
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,460
But I saw it

87
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,020
Cause I like broken back

88
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,760
Just gonna stand there

89
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,420
And hear me burn

90
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,360
I saw it

91
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,340
Cause I love the way

92
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,260
Like

93
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,860
I love the way you lie

94
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,420
I love the way you lie

95
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,320
Now I know we said things

96
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,040
Big things

97
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,100
That we didn't mean

98
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,060
And we saw it back

99
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,200
And it's the same pattern

100
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,140
Same thing

101
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,860
But you're simply too bad as mine

102
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,920
You're saying it's me

103
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,040
When it comes to love you

104
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,880
Just as blinded

105
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,240
Baby please come back

106
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,040
It wasn't you

107
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,080
Baby you was me

108
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,160
Maybe our relationship

109
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,200
Is in this crazy

110
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,860
Is this things

111
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,920
Maybe this is what happens

112
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
When a torn name

113
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,780
meets a volcano

114
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,880
When I know it's not

115
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,800
Love you too much

116
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,860
Talk right up

117
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,640
Come inside

118
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,460
Pick up your bags

119
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,300
On the sidewalk

120
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't do it

121
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,660
It's a fairy

122
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,180
My voice when I talk

123
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,540
Talk to this is my fault

124
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,820
Look me in the alcohol

125
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,300
Next time I press the name

126
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,700
Of this

127
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,680
At the trial wall

128
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,440
Next time

129
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,800
There will be no next time

130
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,740
I apologize

131
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,260
Even though I know it's nice

132
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,640
I'm tired of the games

133
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,600
I just want to best

134
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,720
I know I'm alive

135
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,660
She ever tries to fucking leave a kid

136
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,020
I'm attached to the pen

137
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,400
And said the song so far

138
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,260
She's gone

139
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,140
She's gone

140
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,620
I'm there

141
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,820
Watch me

142
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,340
But

143
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,320
When I saw it

144
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,660
It was like

145
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,020
Waiter

146
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,160
Just go

147
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,020
And stop there

148
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,760
And hear me

149
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,280
But

150
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,480
When I saw it

151
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,640
It was like

152
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,560
I was waiting

153
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,180
I was waiting

154
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,320
I was waiting

155
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,020
I was waiting

156
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,760
I was waiting

157
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,980
I love you.
