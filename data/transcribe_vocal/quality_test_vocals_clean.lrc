[00:00.00]Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
[00:05.04]That's all right cause I like the way it hurts
[00:10.60]Just gonna stand there and hear me burn
[00:16.14]That's all right cause I like the way it lies
[00:22.00]I love the way it lies
[00:25.00]I can't tell you what it really is
[00:26.84]I can tell you what it feels like
[00:28.96]And right now this is still a nightmare of me
[00:31.26]I can't breathe but I still fight
[00:33.38]While I can't fight as long as the wall feels right
[00:36.10]It's like I'm in it's like high above
[00:37.92]Troph on my head
[00:39.14]It's like I'm often hanging and I love it
[00:40.90]The more I suffer
[00:41.82]I stop the chain and break the form
[00:43.60]I'm about to drown
[00:44.44]She just not to taste me
[00:45.88]She fucking hates me
[00:47.14]And I love it way
[00:48.24]Where you going?
[00:49.40]I'm leaving you
[00:50.02]Where you going?
[00:51.14]Come back
[00:51.46]We're running right back
[00:52.62]Here we go again
[00:53.66]So insane cause when it's going
[00:55.44]It's going great
[00:56.24]I'm super married
[00:57.36]But the wind is back
[00:58.36]She's not a slave
[00:59.26]But when it's bad it's awful
[01:00.86]I feel slow to say
[01:02.00]Who's that to?
[01:03.60]I don't even know his name
[01:04.82]I laid hands on her
[01:06.10]I never stood so long again
[01:07.56]I guess I don't know my old dreams
[01:09.26]Just gonna stand there
[01:11.42]And watch me burn
[01:14.38]That's all right cause I like the way it hurts
[01:19.98]Just gonna stand there and hear me burn
[01:25.50]That's all right cause I love the way it hurts
[01:30.84]Love the way it hurts
[01:32.80]Love the way it hurts
[01:36.00]Love the way it hurts
[01:38.64]Love the way it hurts
[01:42.30]Give her a love song
[01:44.14]You can barely breathe
[01:45.16]When you're breathing and you meet
[01:46.38]And neither one of you
[01:47.46]Even though it hit her
[01:48.66]Got the wrong fuzzy feeling
[01:49.92]Get it, she'll use the kid on her
[01:51.58]You can't fucking stick her up to let him
[01:53.52]You're slow, you never hit her
[01:54.86]And I never do nothing
[01:55.74]I've heard her lay her in each other's face
[01:57.54]When you hit her in any births
[01:59.10]When you spit him
[01:59.74]You boost point
[02:00.64]So the sad scratch pops
[02:02.02]And on top
[02:02.90]And I was a loss in my moments
[02:04.48]When you hit her
[02:04.96]And you're surprised that it's a car break
[02:06.70]And chose to go
[02:07.48]So I say I passed the car
[02:08.78]You said it backwards
[02:09.58]Guess it's bad on her
[02:10.62]Cause today
[02:11.22]That was just the day
[02:12.28]Yes, the day is always a different day
[02:14.44]So I like broken back
[02:15.36]It's bad over for your problem
[02:16.84]It's not
[02:17.10]Next time it's over
[02:18.14]You don't kiddin' of a kid
[02:19.88]It's like there's no agenda game
[02:21.36]But you like it
[02:22.30]Now you get to watch a read
[02:23.74]About the window
[02:24.42]Guess what I call it
[02:25.52]Windowplay
[02:26.14]Just gonna stand there
[02:28.70]Watch me burn
[02:31.30]But I saw it
[02:33.46]Cause I like broken back
[02:36.02]Just gonna stand there
[02:39.76]And hear me burn
[02:42.30]I saw it
[02:44.36]Cause I love the way
[02:46.34]Like
[02:48.08]I love the way you lie
[02:49.86]I love the way you lie
[02:59.76]Now I know we said things
[03:01.32]Big things
[03:02.04]That we didn't mean
[03:03.10]And we saw it back
[03:04.06]And it's the same pattern
[03:05.20]Same thing
[03:06.14]But you're simply too bad as mine
[03:07.86]You're saying it's me
[03:08.92]When it comes to love you
[03:10.04]Just as blinded
[03:10.88]Baby please come back
[03:12.24]It wasn't you
[03:13.04]Baby you was me
[03:14.08]Maybe our relationship
[03:15.16]Is in this crazy
[03:16.20]Is this things
[03:16.86]Maybe this is what happens
[03:17.92]When a torn name
[03:18.92]meets a volcano
[03:19.78]When I know it's not
[03:20.88]Love you too much
[03:21.80]Talk right up
[03:22.86]Come inside
[03:23.64]Pick up your bags
[03:24.46]On the sidewalk
[03:25.30]Don't do it
[03:26.00]It's a fairy
[03:26.66]My voice when I talk
[03:28.18]Talk to this is my fault
[03:29.54]Look me in the alcohol
[03:30.82]Next time I press the name
[03:32.30]Of this
[03:32.70]At the trial wall
[03:33.68]Next time
[03:34.44]There will be no next time
[03:35.80]I apologize
[03:36.74]Even though I know it's nice
[03:38.26]I'm tired of the games
[03:39.64]I just want to best
[03:40.60]I know I'm alive
[03:41.72]She ever tries to fucking leave a kid
[03:43.66]I'm attached to the pen
[03:45.02]And said the song so far
[03:46.40]She's gone
[03:47.26]She's gone
[03:48.14]I'm there
[03:48.62]Watch me
[03:49.82]But
[03:51.02]When I saw it
[03:53.32]It was like
[03:54.66]Waiter
[03:56.02]Just go
[03:58.16]And stop there
[03:59.74]And hear me
[04:00.76]But
[04:03.02]When I saw it
[04:04.48]It was like
[04:05.64]I was waiting
[04:06.56]I was waiting
[04:09.18]I was waiting
[04:10.32]I was waiting
[04:13.08]I was waiting
[04:14.76]I love you.
