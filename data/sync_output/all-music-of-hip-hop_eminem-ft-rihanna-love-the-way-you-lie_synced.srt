1
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,600
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,880
That's alright because I like the way it hurts.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,160
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,800
That's alright because I love the way you lie.

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,580
I love the way you lie.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,840
I can't tell you what it really is.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,960
I can only tell you what it feels like.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,580
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,380
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight.

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,080
As long as the wall feels right it's like I'm in flight.

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,580
High off a log, choke on my hate.

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,700
It's like I'm huffing pain and I love it the more I suffer.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,400
I suffocate and break a form about to drown.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,200
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,060
And I love it, wait, where you going?

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,500
I'm leaving you.

17
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,020
No you ain't, come back.

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,680
We're running right back.

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,720
Here we go again, it's so insane.

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,220
Cause when it's going good it's going great.

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,360
I'm Superman with the wind in his back.

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,840
She's slow and slain for when it's bad, it's awful.

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,300
I feel so ashamed, I snap, who's next to me?

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,080
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on him.

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,280
I never stooped so long again, I guess I don't know my own strength.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn.

27
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:56,440
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts.

28
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,200
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry.

29
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,180
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts.

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,680
I love the way you lie.

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,240
I love the way you lie.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,880
I love the way you lie.

33
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,280
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with them.

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,640
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit them.

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, getting chills used to get them.

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,660
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at them.

37
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,880
You swore you'd never hit them, never do nothing to hurt them.

38
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,520
Now you're in each other's face.

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
Be within them.

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,720
And you burst when you spit them.

41
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,060
You push, pull each other's heads.

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,560
Scratch, pop, hit them, thump, tap, hit them.

43
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,600
So lost in the moments when you're in them.

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,640
It's the phrase that you call break and chose your bones.

45
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,140
So they say it best, they call you separate ways.

46
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,900
Guess that they don't know you cause today, that was yesterday.

47
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,460
Yesterday is always a different day.

48
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,140
It's not like broken records playing over what you promised them.

49
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,940
Next time they'll show restraint.

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,440
You don't get another chance.

51
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,320
Life is not a tango game, but you lie to gain.

52
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,440
Now you get to watch her leap out the window.

53
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,140
Guess that's why they call it windowpane.

54
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,340
Just gonna stand there.

55
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,940
Watch me burn.

56
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,240
But that's all right, because I left the way it hurts.

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,940
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry.

58
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,920
But that's all right, because I left the way it lies.

59
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,560
I left the way it lies.

60
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,120
I left the way it lies.

61
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,040
Now I know we said things, big things that we didn't mean.

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,200
And we fall back into the same pattern.

63
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,040
Seventeen, but your temper's just as bad as mine is.

64
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,680
You're the same as me when it comes to love you just as blinded.

65
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,180
Baby, please come back.

66
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,220
It wasn't you.

67
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,720
Baby, it was me.

68
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,220
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems.

69
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,680
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano.

70
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,600
While I know it's not love you too much.

71
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,100
Talk away now.

72
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Come inside.

73
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,660
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk.

74
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Don't you hear some snaring?

75
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,840
And my voice when I talk?

76
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,340
Told you this is my fault.

77
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,840
Look me in the eyeball.

78
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,700
Next time I'll pistol aim my fist at the drywall.

79
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,280
Next time.

80
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,780
There will be no next time.

81
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,280
I apologize, even though I know it's lies.

82
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,580
I'm tired of the games.

83
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,500
I just wanna bounce.

84
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,720
I know I'm alive.

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,420
If she ever tries to fucking leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire.

86
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,920
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn.

87
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,920
But that's all right, because I left the way it hurts.

88
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,420
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn.

89
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,920
And she was right, but I'm lost.

90
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,420
I wanna stay there and you'll be fine.

91
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,900
That's all right, because I left the way it hurts.

92
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,540
I left the way it hurts.

93
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,040
I left the way it hurts.
