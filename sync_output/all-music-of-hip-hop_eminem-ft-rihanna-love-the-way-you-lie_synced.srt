1
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,600
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,880
That's alright cause I like the way it hurts

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,160
Just gonna stand there and hear me burn

4
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:56,440
That's alright cause I like the way it lies

5
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,240
I love the way it lies

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,840
I can't tell you what it really is

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,960
I can tell you what it feels like

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,580
And right now this is still a nightmare of me

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,380
I can't breathe, but I still fight

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,080
While I can't fight

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,580
As long as the wall feels right

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,140
It's like I'm in it's like

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,640
I have a lot of trouble I hate

14
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,580
It's like I'm often hanging in a love of the wall

15
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,080
I stop the chain and break the form

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,400
I'm about to drown

17
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,580
She just not to taste me

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,200
She fucking hates me

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,060
And I love it, wait

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,720
Where you going?

21
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,500
I'm leaving you

22
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,020
Oh yeah, come back

23
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,680
We're running right back

24
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,280
Here we go again

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,300
So insane

26
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,680
Cause when it's going good

27
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,360
It's gonna be great

28
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,860
I'm super married

29
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,840
But the wind is bad

30
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,340
She's not a slave from when it's bad

31
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,260
It's awful

32
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,760
I feel slow to say

33
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,600
Who's that to?

34
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,080
I don't even know his name

35
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,580
I laid hands on her

36
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,280
I never stood so long again

37
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,900
I guess I don't know my own strength

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

39
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,180
That's alright cause I like the way it hurts

40
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,200
Just gonna stand there and hear me burn

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,120
That's alright cause I love the way it hurts

42
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,920
I love the way it hurts

43
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,560
I love the way it hurts

44
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,280
If I love somebody so much

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
You barely breathe when you're breathing

46
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,640
And neither one of you

47
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,140
Even though it hit him

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Got the wrong fuzzy feeling

49
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,140
Get him chills

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,720
You stick hit him

51
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,220
And are you beating so hard

52
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,720
You stick hooked in at him

53
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,880
You school you never hit him

54
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,040
Never didn't learn

55
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,540
There were no other nations

56
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,520
In each other's space

57
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,020
It wouldn't be in him any burst

58
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,520
When he spit him

59
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,940
You pushed point to the sand

60
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Scrat's coffin on top

61
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,460
And I was lost in my moments

62
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,420
And I used the phrase

63
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,920
Did it count?

64
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,420
Raking, choses, both

65
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,640
So I say I best echo

66
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,140
You sit between ways

67
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Get me fat on your chest today

68
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,140
That was just the joke

69
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,640
Yes, I'm dead

70
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,460
It's all worth a different day

71
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,960
You select yourself

72
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,460
And I quit playing over

73
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,960
But you problemless stuff

74
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,700
Next time is so great

75
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,200
You don't kiddin' another chance

76
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,700
Life is no pretend a game

77
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,680
But you like it

78
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,440
Now you get to want to read about the window, guess it's what I call it, window play.

79
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,340
Just gonna stand there, watch me burn.

80
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,920
But I saw it because I like the way it hurts.

81
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,940
Just gonna stand there and hear me burn.

82
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,800
That's all right because I love the way it lies.

83
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,900
I love the way it lies.

84
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,540
I love the way it lies.

85
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,040
Now I know we said things, things, things that we didn't mean.

86
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,200
And we fall back into the same pattern.

87
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,040
Same team, but you're simply too bad as mine.

88
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,540
You're saying it's me when it comes to love.

89
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,040
You just invited me.

90
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,540
Please come back.

91
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,140
It wasn't you.

92
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,220
Baby, you was me.

93
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,720
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems.

94
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,680
Maybe that's what happens when a torn name meets a volcano.

95
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,600
I know it's gonna love you so much.

96
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,100
Talk right up, come inside.

97
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,660
Pick up your bags on the side, Bob.

98
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Don't you hear me?

99
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,840
My voice will not talk to you.

100
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,340
This is my Bob.

101
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,840
Look me in the eye, Bob.

102
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,340
Next time I press the name of this perpetrator, Bob.

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Next time there will be no next time.

104
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,340
I apologize even though I know it's nice.

105
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,840
I'm tired of the games.

106
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,340
I just want to pass.

107
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,720
I know I'm alive.

108
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,220
See I've been trying to fucking leave again.

109
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,720
I'm attached to the pen set the sky so I'm fine.

110
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,500
I just got a spell there.

111
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,940
Don't watch me, Bob.

112
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,440
What I saw right now is a lack of words.

113
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,240
Just got a spell there and you'll be fine.

114
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,740
What I saw right now is a lack of words.
