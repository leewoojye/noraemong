[00:00.00]Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
[00:05.04]That's alright cause I like the way it hurts
[00:10.60]Just gonna stand there and hear me burn
[00:16.14]That's alright cause I like the way it lies
[00:22.00]I love the way it lies
[00:25.00]I can't tell you what it really is
[00:26.84]I can tell you what it feels like
[00:28.96]And right now this is still a nightmare of me
[00:31.26]I can't breathe, but I still fight
[00:33.38]While I can't fight
[03:24.46]As long as the wall feels right
[00:36.10]It's like I'm in it's like
[04:10.46]I have a lot of trouble I hate
[00:39.14]It's like I'm often hanging in a love of the wall
[00:41.82]I stop the chain and break the form
[00:43.60]I'm about to drown
[00:44.44]She just not to taste me
[00:45.88]She fucking hates me
[00:47.14]And I love it, wait

[00:52.62]Here we go again
[00:53.66]So insane
[00:55.44]Cause when it's going good
[03:50.58]It's gonna be great
[00:56.24]I'm super married
[00:57.36]But the wind is bad
[00:58.36]She's not a slave from when it's bad
[00:59.26]It's awful
[01:00.86]I feel slow to say
[01:02.00]Who's that to?
[01:03.60]I don't even know his name
[01:04.82]I laid hands on her
[01:06.10]I never stood so long again
[01:07.56]I guess I don't know my own strength
[01:09.26]Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
[01:14.38]That's alright cause I like the way it hurts
[01:19.98]Just gonna stand there and hear me burn
[02:44.42]That's alright cause I love the way it hurts
[02:53.52]I love the way it hurts
[02:54.68]I love the way it hurts
[01:42.32]If I love somebody so much
[01:44.26]You barely breathe when you're breathing
[02:39.76]And neither one of you
[01:47.62]Even though it hit him
[01:48.66]Got the wrong fuzzy feeling
[01:51.16]Get him chills
[01:50.66]You stick hit him
[00:50.02]And are you beating so hard
[01:59.22]You stick hooked in at him
[01:53.50]You school you never hit him
[03:02.04]Never didn't learn
[03:03.58]There were no other nations
[01:56.50]In each other's space
[03:25.30]It wouldn't be in him any burst
[02:04.48]When he spit him
[01:59.76]You pushed point to the sand
[02:01.28]Scrat's coffin on top
[02:02.94]And I was lost in my moments
[04:01.44]And I used the phrase
[02:16.84]Did it count?
[02:05.82]Raking, choses, both
[02:50.12]So I say I best echo
[02:08.78]You sit between ways
[02:10.62]Get me fat on your chest today
[02:11.22]That was just the joke
[02:09.70]Yes, I'm dead
[02:12.28]It's all worth a different day
[02:14.94]You select yourself
[02:18.44]And I quit playing over
[02:21.32]But you problemless stuff
[03:30.82]Next time is so great
[02:18.56]You don't kiddin' another chance
[02:19.90]Life is no pretend a game
[03:06.18]But you like it
[02:23.74]Now you get to want to read about the window, guess it's what I call it, window play.
[02:26.16]Just gonna stand there, watch me burn.
[02:30.58]But I saw it because I like the way it hurts.
[02:36.90]Just gonna stand there and hear me burn.
[01:30.90]That's all right because I love the way it lies.
[01:25.50]I love the way it lies.
[01:33.36]I love the way it lies.
[02:59.40]Now I know we said things, things, things that we didn't mean.
[03:03.08]And we fall back into the same pattern.
[03:05.16]Same team, but you're simply too bad as mine.
[03:08.04]You're saying it's me when it comes to love.
[03:10.02]You just invited me.
[03:10.86]Please come back.
[03:12.22]It wasn't you.
[03:13.04]Baby, you was me.
[03:14.08]Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems.
[03:17.90]Maybe that's what happens when a torn name meets a volcano.
[03:20.60]I know it's gonna love you so much.
[03:22.82]Talk right up, come inside.
[03:23.64]Pick up your bags on the side, Bob.
[03:28.16]Don't you hear me?
[03:26.66]My voice will not talk to you.
[03:16.84]This is my Bob.
[03:29.52]Look me in the eye, Bob.
[03:31.32]Next time I press the name of this perpetrator, Bob.
[03:34.82]Next time there will be no next time.
[03:38.32]I apologize even though I know it's nice.
[03:31.62]I'm tired of the games.
[03:32.52]I just want to pass.
[03:32.02]I know I'm alive.
[03:33.18]See I've been trying to fucking leave again.
[04:02.58]I'm attached to the pen set the sky so I'm fine.
[04:03.42]I just got a spell there.
[02:28.70]Don't watch me, Bob.
[02:41.42]What I saw right now is a lack of words.
[02:44.92]Just got a spell there and you'll be fine.
[03:21.80]What I saw right now is a lack of words.
