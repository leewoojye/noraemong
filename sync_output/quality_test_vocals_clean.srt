1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,800
That's alright cause I like the way it hurts

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,160
Just gonna stand there and hear me burn

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,040
That's alright cause I like the way it lies

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
I love the way it lies

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,840
I can't tell you what it really is

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,960
I can tell you what it feels like

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,260
And right now this is still a nightmare of me

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,380
I can't breathe, but I still fight

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,100
While I can't fight

11
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,300
As long as the wall feels right

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,920
It's like I'm in it's like

13
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,960
I have a lot of trouble I hate

14
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,900
It's like I'm often hanging in a love of the wall

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,600
I stop the chain and break the form

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,440
I'm about to drown

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,880
She just not to taste me

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,140
She fucking hates me

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,240
And I love it, wait

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,040
Where you going?

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,020
I'm leaving you

22
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,460
Oh yeah, come back

23
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,620
We're running right back

24
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,660
Here we go again

25
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,440
So insane

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,240
Cause when it's going good

27
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:57,420
It's gonna be great

28
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm super married

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
But the wind is bad

30
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,260
She's not a slave from when it's bad

31
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,860
It's awful

32
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,000
I feel slow to say

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,320
Who's that to?

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,820
I don't even know his name

35
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,100
I laid hands on her

36
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,560
I never stood so long again

37
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,260
I guess I don't know my own strength

38
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,420
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

39
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,020
That's alright cause I like the way it hurts

40
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,140
Just gonna stand there and hear me burn

41
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,360
That's alright cause I love the way it hurts

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,680
I love the way it hurts

43
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,400
I love the way it hurts

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,260
If I love somebody so much

45
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,620
You barely breathe when you're breathing

46
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,420
And neither one of you

47
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,660
Even though it hit him

48
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,660
Got the wrong fuzzy feeling

49
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,160
Get him chills

50
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,580
You stick hit him

51
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,960
And are you beating so hard

52
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,760
You stick hooked in at him

53
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,860
You school you never hit him

54
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,080
Never didn't learn

55
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,580
There were no other nations

56
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,540
In each other's space

57
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,000
It wouldn't be in him any burst

58
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,120
When he spit him

59
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,280
You pushed point to the sand

60
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,040
Scrat's coffin on top

61
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,480
And I was lost in my moments

62
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,960
And I used the phrase

63
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,120
Did it count?

64
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,460
Raking, choses, both

65
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,280
So I say I best echo

66
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,700
You sit between ways

67
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,220
Get me fat on your chest today

68
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,280
That was just the joke

69
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,620
Yes, I'm dead

70
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,440
It's all worth a different day

71
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,940
You select yourself

72
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,440
And I quit playing over

73
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,300
But you problemless stuff

74
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,620
Next time is so great

75
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,900
You don't kiddin' another chance

76
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,320
Life is no pretend a game

77
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,460
But you like it

78
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,420
Now you get to want to read about the window, guess it's what I call it, window play.

79
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,700
Just gonna stand there, watch me burn.

80
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,460
But I saw it because I like the way it hurts.

81
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,760
Just gonna stand there and hear me burn.

82
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,800
That's all right because I love the way it lies.

83
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,020
I love the way it lies.

84
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,260
I love the way it lies.

85
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,320
Now I know we said things, things, things that we didn't mean.

86
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,040
And we fall back into the same pattern.

87
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,180
Same team, but you're simply too bad as mine.

88
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,920
You're saying it's me when it comes to love.

89
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,860
You just invited me.

90
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,220
Please come back.

91
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,040
It wasn't you.

92
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,080
Baby, you was me.

93
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,580
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems.

94
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,900
Maybe that's what happens when a torn name meets a volcano.

95
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,800
I know it's gonna love you so much.

96
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,640
Talk right up, come inside.

97
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,460
Pick up your bags on the side, Bob.

98
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,860
Don't you hear me?

99
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,160
My voice will not talk to you.

100
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,900
This is my Bob.

101
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,820
Look me in the eye, Bob.

102
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,320
Next time I press the name of this perpetrator, Bob.

103
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
Next time there will be no next time.

104
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,320
I apologize even though I know it's nice.

105
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,020
I'm tired of the games.

106
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,520
I just want to pass.

107
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,680
I know I'm alive.

108
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,180
See I've been trying to fucking leave again.

109
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:02,920
I'm attached to the pen set the sky so I'm fine.

110
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,420
I just got a spell there.

111
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,580
Don't watch me, Bob.

112
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,420
What I saw right now is a lack of words.

113
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Just got a spell there and you'll be fine.

114
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,820
What I saw right now is a lack of words.
